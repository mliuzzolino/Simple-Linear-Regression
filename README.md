# Simple-Linear-Regression

## Introduction
This script is a simple linear regression that optimizes the b0 and b1 parameters of model y=b0 + b1*x to find the linear model of best fit for a given set of data.

The sample data is found within /data/ directory. 

The result is a plot showing the line of best fit (blue dotted line) alongside the data points (red dots) used to construct the line.

## Running the script
Load desired csv file into /data/ directory; ensure the csv file is named "input.csv". 

From the parent directory, run the following command:

	python main.py
